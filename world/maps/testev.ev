@desc |YYou step through the swirling vortex and find yourself in the heart of the Chaos Realm. The air crackles with energy, and the sky above shifts through a kaleidoscope of colors. The ground beneath your feet is uneven, made up of jagged rocks and patches of strange, glowing vegetation. In the distance, you can see twisted, otherworldly structures that defy the laws of physics. The atmosphere is thick with an eerie, almost tangible sense of unpredictability.

Amidst the chaos, the swirling vortex you entered through remains a constant, its shimmering surface offering a way back to the familiar safety of your town. The vortex pulses gently, as if beckoning you to return whenever you are ready.
