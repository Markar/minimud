@desc |yA swirling vortex of pure Chaos. You can jump through the vortex to get back to the safety of town, or you can choose to explore the realm.|/|/You step through the swirling vortex and find yourself in the heart of the Chaos Realm. The air crackles with energy, and the sky above shifts through a kaleidoscope of colors. The ground beneath your feet is uneven, made up of jagged rocks and patches of strange, glowing vegetation. In the distance, you can see twisted, otherworldly structures that defy the laws of physics. The atmosphere is thick with an eerie, almost tangible sense of unpredictability.|/|/Amidst the chaos, the swirling vortex you entered through remains a constant, its shimmering surface offering a way back to the familiar safety of your town. The vortex pulses gently, as if beckoning you to return whenever you are ready.

@dig/teleport In front of a chessboard;chaos#2 : typeclasses.rooms.Room = east;e,west;w
#
@desc |GThe room is dominated by a life-size chessboard, each square large enough to accommodate a full-grown person. On the black and white tiles, gnolls and skeletons clash in a fierce battle. The gnolls, with their hyena-like features and crude armor, snarl and swing their weapons with savage intensity. Opposing them, skeletal warriors, their bones clattering with each movement, wield rusted swords and shields. The air is thick with the sounds of combat, and the eerie glow of torches casts flickering shadows across the scene, making the battle seem almost otherworldly.
